# Array Processing Time Analysis

## Overview

This Python script, `array_processing.py`, explores the time complexity of the `process_array` function under different scenarios. The script generates arrays of varying sizes and compositions to analyze processing time for best-case, average-case, and worst-case inputs.

## Function Details 

The core of the analysis lies in the `process_array` function. It navigates through an input array, employing nested loops and conditional statements to perform various operations. The goal is to understand the time complexity implications of the function.

## Input Arrays

1. Best-case scenario:
- Array filled with zeros.
2. Average-case scenario:
- Randomly generated arrays with elements 0, 1, or 2.
3. Worst-case scenario:
- Array filled with ones.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the command: python3 `array_processing.py`.

## Results

The script outputs elapsed time for processing arrays of different sizes and scenarios, including best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios.

## Interpreting Results

- Elapsed time provides insights into the time complexity of the process_array function.
- Compare times across scenarios and array sizes to gauge performance implications.

## Dependencies

- `time` module for measuring elapsed time.
- `random` module for generating random arrays in the average-case scenario.

## Usage Tips

- Experiment with various array sizes to observe how the function's performance scales.
- Modify the `process_array` function for alternative time complexity analyses.

Feel free to explore and adapt this script for your specific use cases and performance analysis needs.

Happy coding!
